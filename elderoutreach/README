DESCRIPTION
Codebase for the backend for EngAge.
EngAge is an app which connects the aged community. It offers ways to add friends, attend events, send messages and keep up to date with how friends are feeling. It makes use of this information by communicating it to health authorities for better upkeep of community wellbeing.

REQUIREMENTS
The codebase was written on a unix server and so a unix system is advised.
This project utilises the django framework package for server-client communication.
Requires host with open port and valid SSL certificate.
Needs gunicorn, nginx and certbot packages installed.

The project was created on a system running OpenBSD and using the exact packages:
	nginx-1.22.0_6,2
	py39-certbot-1.27.0,1
	py39-certbot-nginx-1.27.0
	py39-django40-4.0.7

INSTRUCTIONS
Use certbot to create valid SSL certificate.
Start NGINX as a service to allow it to redirect http traffic to gunicorn which can't handle it natively.
	On a BSD host: for hosts using systemd or "service nginx start"
	On a host using systemd: "systemctl start nginx"
	On a host using OpenRC: "rc-service nginx start"
From the master directory, run "gunicorn -c config/gunicorn/dev.py" to host the necessary endpoints.
Program can now handle server requests.
